# Heap-sorting-algorithm
One of the sorting algorithms 

The heap sorting algorithm finds the smallest or the largest value in an array of values.
Continues by placing the value at the beggining and the end of the array respectively.
The same proccess is repeated for the rest values in the array.
As for the output, eventually, the first value will be the smallest and the last will be the largest.
